introducing flashflow, a basic flashcard app with quiz functionality
you can flip through cards, and when you're ready, take a quiz to test your knowledge
powered by good ol' html, css, and javascript



## features

- flip flashcards to see the back
- navigate through cards with "next" and "previous" buttons
- start a quiz to test your knowledge on the flashcards
- simple scoring system to track how well you do

## built with

- html
- css
- javascript

## maybe more later

this was made in an hour, so it's a bit rough around the edges. but hey, it's a start! might add more features or polish it up down the line if i get the time.

cheers!
